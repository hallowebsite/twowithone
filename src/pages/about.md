# About

Piotr, one of our collaborators, being a Polish immigrant in Germany had a good laugh when
he discovered that in Germany they say [Zwei Fliegen mit einer Klappe schlagen](/german)

A saying that in English he knew as quite boring [To kill two birds with one stone](/english)
and in Polish is actually too quite funny [Upiec dwie pieczenie na jednym ogniu](/polish)

So we started wondering, what are the variants of this in other languages.

It is not an easy thing to google or automatically translate, as automatic translators
just tend to return a local version of the saying and not a literal translation. Luckily
Aachen is a pretty international city so we were able to quickly collect examples in many
languages from native speakers.

We thought it might be a funny way to explore the world and thus the project was born.

## Illustrations

As most of us are quite visual people these days we thought it will be fun to add some
nice images to every saying. Initially we planned on using AI generated images but then
thought that after all maybe it is better to showcase creativity of some real people standing
behind the languages. So we looked for Public Domain images at least loosely connected
with the saying in a particular language and when possible from general area where the language
is used.

Of course the success rate in this kind of search varies, but we will be very happy
to get suggestions for better (public domain) works to illustrate the sayings (use [the contact form](/add))

## A bit about technology

As this is a "side fun project" we could take time to make it right.

The site uses fantastic [Astro](https://astro.build) with hybrid server side rendering, which
means that sites that remain static (like pages for particular languages) are generated as
static html and just served as such from a CDN (Content Delivery Network). While sites that
require some interactivity (like the main page where you can see a random language every time)
are server generated using very handy and fast [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) pages.

We took to heart also a proper progressive enhancment - site is functional and allows browsing
through the languages without javascript enabled. A little bit of javascript sprinkled here and there
using a standard Web Components is used to things a bit more fun.
